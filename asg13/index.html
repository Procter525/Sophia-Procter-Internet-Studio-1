          <p>I believe this would a great entrance level job, because it gets me used to working with the technology and gives me room to better my skills in customer service. I personally love putting up and taking down gear, which is essentially half of this job. It will be small scale which is excellent for a starter job and decently low stakes as it's no stadium. In a hotel, they usually have a designated audio system, so I will probably be using consistent gear and get more familiar with it, which is also beneficial.</p>

          <p>This one is also in a hospitality environment and has a lot to do with set up and take down. I would be learning adaptability with each new and different event that I would be working at. On top of that, there is still a lot of room to laern and grow by getting used to different kinds of equipment and learning about new kinds of equipment that is most likely more suited to the hospitatily workplaces. My interpersonal skills would also be worked on as a lot of this job also involves talking to clients.</p>

          <p>The way this company structure works is that there is an overarching company that is in charge of the hiring and then the physical location works with theat company to get hirees. The Over company in this scenario is Live Nation, and the physical venue is House of Blues Dallas. I would probably get paid to run sound board and help set up by Live Nation, but my managers and higher ups would also work for Hous of Blues Dallas. I would probably be most excited for this job since this is a distinctly live sound venue and I would be given the oppurtunity to learn about their in house sound system and how they use their sound system with the group's sound gear when they come through and play.</p>
