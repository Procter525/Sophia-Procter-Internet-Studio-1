	<h1>Assignment 3: Reading</h1>
	<h3>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design: Violation of Number 6 (Ensure clickable elements look like they are clickable.)</h3>

	<h3>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas?</h3>
		<p>Using a story format for projects can keep a flow of one idea going by getting to decide what happens next. It can make the project immersive and use the storlyine to communicate the goals, aspirations and final product of the project. A website is very similar to simply telling a story in the sense that when following a websites structure, you learn more about whatever the website is discussing. It tells the story of the subject and the audience gets to choose the adventure and order of events that they see in whatever order they see fit.</p>
	<h3>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design?</h3>
		<p>Establishing hiearchy can be done by putting information in the order of importance, which is commonly executed by ordering the information physically based on the language, for instance, in English people read top to bottom, so if making a list put the important information on the top. Another way to order importance is to show the important information in a way that makes it stand out, like making the important vocabulary bolded or underlined, or simply making it a headline and in bigger font.</p>
		<p>Here is an example of good hierarchy: <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpodallas/">Fan Expo Dallas</a></p>

	<h1>Assignment 3: Creative Brief</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Problem: I have unspecified, undocumented and untested tech equipment that I personally own.</li>
			<li>Audience: Myself and anyone else who wants to use my equipment, with my permission.</li>
			<li>Competition: This information is not necessarily competitive with anyone else as it will just be a catalog and/or database.</li>
			<li>Key Message: Uncertainty now in my personal tech equipment leads to big problems later when attempting to use the equipment.</li>
			<li>Call to Action: Wanting to use and document all of the tech equipment that I own since I know I will be using it for future jobs and for personal gain. I also would like to have knowledge of what all of my equipment is called and what its uses are.</li>
			<li>How to Measure Success: When I can safely navigate and find any piece of equipment that I own and am able to check on the details of the product, what it is used for and where I personally keep it in my physical organization system (my gear bags and cabinets).</li>
