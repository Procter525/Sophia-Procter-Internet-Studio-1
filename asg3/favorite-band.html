	<h1>Green Day</h1>
	<img src="img/green day.webp" alt="Green Day" width="500">
	<p><a href="https://greenday.com/">Green Day</a> is a band from Oakland, California that has been a part of the punk scene since the late 1980s. They are at heart a trio comprised of Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool that has been together since the bands' second album Kerplunk! The band hit it big after the release of their third album Dookie in 1994 and have been largely in the public eye ever since. Green Day has dominated both punk and pop punk in record sales and popularity since then and have only grown a larger fanbase since the releases of albums such as American Idiot and singles such as Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).</p>
	<p>Green Day will always hold a special place in my heart because I will never get tired of hearing their music. I listen to their entire discography at minimum once a month and I have dedicated lots of my musical ventures to learning how to play their songs on guitar, bass and drumset, the latter of which I have claimed to be able to play any song in their discography (which is pretty much true). Green Day's lyrics often hit home for me, and even if they don't they feel meaningful as well as the chord progressions behind them, because in many ways Green Day songs are simple on paper, but the complexity of the mindset behind those songs will always fascinate me, even if I never completely understand everything.</p>
