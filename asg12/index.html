	<h1>Favorite Films</h1>
		<p>I could not decide which movies I genuinely wanted to put as my favorites, so what I decided to do instead was pick a movie from the <a href="https://www.foximusic.com/the-12-basic-film-genres-and-their-sub-genres/">12 Basic Film Genres list</a> that I found. My initial idea was to put all of the Star Wars films though, so it's probably worth mentioning that I love those films. As a backup plan I was going to include every Middle Earth related film, so probably also worth another mention.</p>
