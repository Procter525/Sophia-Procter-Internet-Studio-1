	<h1>Activities</h1>

	
	<h3>Boat Adventures</h3>
	<aside class="shipyard">
		<h4>The Shipyard</h4>

	</aside>
	<p>Here on Berk, maritime is a requirement, not a luxury, but we here on Berk do maritime luxuriously. We have a shipyard and a dock to keep our boats in ship-shape and take visitors on fishing adventures as well as on boat tours around the island to see Berk from a different perspective.</p>
	<p>If you are looking for a way to cool off in the summer sun then our rapids boat tour to the Mother of Dragon's den is for you. This is a high energy boat tour led by the one and only Spitelout. He guides you away from the island and into the oncoming storm where there are many fun twists and turns leading to the Red Death's Nest, which is now abandoned and the perfect place to learn a little more about Berk's history, while having a picnic on the ashy shores.</p>

	<h3>Island Adventures</h3>
	<aside class="cove">
		<h4>The Cove</h4>
		<img src="images/the-cove.webp" width="400">
	</aside>
	<p>Our landscape is rocky upon first look, but as you explore more of the island you will find that there is more than meets the eye. A forest and a few plains line the backside of the island and give the island more greenary and some quiet from the hustle and bustle of the main area in the village. It is quite cold in the Arcipelago in general, but it can be extra cold here on Berk, however, we have many fur shops and clothing stores that can help you accomidate for the freezing temperatures.</p>
	<p>We have on foot tours through the village and along the backside of the island where there is more greenery to get new folks used to the landscape or to just enjoy the sights. One of the main stops on the walking tour is The Cove, which is important to Berk history, because The Cove is where Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III first trained Toothless the King of Dragons to be ridden and where their friendship blossomed. You will have about half an hour to explore this area and soak in the cool water at the center of The Cove. Extra clothing is not provided, please be prepared to walk around wet if you choose to go into the large pond.</p>

	<h3>Dragon Adventures</h3>
	<aside class="dragons">
		<h4>Dragon Racing</h4>
		<img src="images/turning-the-corner.webp" width="400">
	</aside>
	<p>Since we have discovered how Dragons are amazing and kind creatures, we have also dedicated a great deal of our island to taking care of them. The rest of the Archipelago seems to still not be quite onboard with this idea, but we know the truth. We have stables, feeding stations, and workshops to keep the dragons (and the villagers) happy, healthy and supplied.</p>
	<p>One of the highlight of having a great relationship with Dragons is that we can enjoy fun activities with them. Some of the activities we offer are Dragon Riding school for the little kids, Dragon Tours for those who just want a different perspective of the island itself, and for those competent at Dragon riding, we have Dragon Racing. Dragon Racing is not for the faint of heart and requires prrof of Dragon riding experience in the form of an exam proctored by the one and only Astrid Hofferson.</p>
