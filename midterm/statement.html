	<h3>Location and Fonts</h3>
	<p>The first thing I of course decided on was the location I was going to choose. Initially I wanted to make a real place a website, but then I figured that pretty much every real place I would want to make a website for already has a website, so I kind of made the best of both real and fictional and picked Berk. Berk is the fictional island from How To Train Your Dragon, but also an area in the new Universal Orlando Park called Epic Universe. I wanted teh fonts to match the Viking aesthetic as well as the older fantastical world so I went searching for handwriting fonts and came accross one called "Bilbo" which ended up being perfect for heading words. I also happened to stumble upon "East Sea Dokdo" which has ended up looking really similar to the way Hiccup writes in the first movie, but in English, so I stuck with it for lists and paragraphs.</p>

	<h3>Header and Footer</h3>
	<p>This is genuinely where most of my time and effort has gone. I spent hours making the header and footer looks as realistic to a website as possible and I think it paid off. The header I wanted to initially be off to the right side, speciically the words, not the dark colored bar, but the more I messed with the font size I realized that centered would look better. It is at this point I chose the color scheme, which matches the main dragon in the series, Toothless' color palette of a dark and almost blck color and a lighter green. Even though in the films the darker color leans more towards blue I decided to keep my colors consistent and made the darker color a really dark shade of green. Onto the footer, I really wanted a simplistic design of the written information, then the buttons, so that's exactly what I did. I kept the color palette consistent and added an animation to the buttons making them scale up when you hover over them.</p>

	<h3>Content and Images</h3>
	<p>The bain of my existence when it comes to CSS is fitting images. To get a consistent large image on each page I not only had to go find really large images, but I also had to scale them up, down or scrunch them enough to fit in the exact same amount of space on each page. As far as content around the images though, I tried to stick to simplistic paragraph formations that look clean and portray the information properly and effectively. I always used headers though so that whoever ends up reading has the oppurtunity ho have an idea of what they are about to read without going in blind to a random assortment of paragraphs. These headings are also where I was able to name the restaurants and important areas on Berk in a way that still make sense to the fictional world and to the concept of Berk being a tourist attraction. Other images surrounding this area I tried to move around a lot to look more aesthetically pleasing while not confusing the audience, hence the aside boxes in the Activities tab.</p>
