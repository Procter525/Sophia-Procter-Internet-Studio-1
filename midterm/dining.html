	<h1>Dining Options</h1>

	<h3>The Great Hall</h3>
	<img src="images/great-hall.jpg" width="700">
	<p>The Great Hall is the epitomy of Viking eating. Enjoy a hardy meal and a good time with new Viking friends in the cafeteria style restaurant where you go in and pick up food at the counter and then sit down in the chaotic dragon and human filled seating area. If you want to be in the middle of the action feel free to sit in the center of The Great Hall, if you want a more quiet, yet still immersive experience sit around the edges of the room, it will still be boystrous enough to get the full Great Hall experience.</p>

	<h3>Red Death Deli</h3>
	<img src="images/eating.webp" width="700">
	<p>As part of the tour to the Red Death's Nest you can go to the Red Death Deli. This ashy filled island is complemented by the fun picnic food style Deli that has sandwiches and cold cuts galore. Pick up a sandwich meal and a refreshing drink and then rent a picnic blanket to get the full Red Death's Nest experience. Sit out on the ashy ground (which is more comfortable then it sounds, we promise) and enjoy the cool fog and the histroical sites that are part of the island. This dining option is a great stop for the tour and will fill your belly up and have you ready to make the rapids trek back to the Berk mainland.</p>

	<h3>Grub Station</h3>
	<img src="images/fish.jpg" width="700">
	<p>Near the shipyard is this simple Berkian delicacy and pick-me-up Grub Station. This is where the majority of the seafood dishes are featured and cooked to perfection. Some of the fish that are cooked at the Grub Station are salmon, Icelandic cod and smoked eel which are served with the fresh vegetables grown on the island. It is a great place to stop by if you are hungry right when you arrive and/or craving some seafood after crossing the ocean to get to our island of Berk.</p>
