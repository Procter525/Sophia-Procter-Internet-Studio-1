	<h1>Article Questions and Answers</h1>
		<h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h1>
			<p>Structured content is planned, developed and connected outside of an interface and if focused on small amounts of data that relates to one another whereas semantic HTML communicates information relating to relationships between document elements.</p>
		<h2>How do they work together?</h1>
			<p>When data is broken down into small chunks of information semantic HTML can then be used to show off this information in the form of information boxes on a search engine or simply grouped together on a website.</p>
		<h2>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h1>

		<h2>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h2>
			<p>The tactic of Go for "Good" Instead of Superlative because in many cases I have tried to aim for perfection and my headspace just gets more jumbled and confused. I actually started using this tactic back in middle school and it has been working for me ever since.</p>
		<h2>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h2>
			<p>Hyperbolic discounting is the trendoncy to become more rational when that person is forced to wait, which is essentially procrastination. One method of countering hyperbolic discounting though is to trick your mind into thinking that the "now you" can't trust "future you" and therefore should do the work no instead of later, because "future you" will give in to the sidetracking temptations.</p>
		<h2>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h2>
			<p>As a publisher of my work I have Networking power and at least partial Network-making power, but not Network power or Networked power because those are more related to the technology itself, not necesarily what any one publisher can control.</p>
