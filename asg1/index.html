	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Future assignements will be listed here.</p>

	<h2>What I learned from the reading</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>There are three versions of the web. Each version evolved and is associated with different application.</li>
		<li>Flash and image replacement were used for custom fonts and helped to start to stray from using the big five.</li>
		<li>Responsive design and Mobile apps helped lead to having access to the web from smart phones and any size of screen.</li>
	</ul>
    
	<h2>Semester Project Ideas</h2>
	<p>I would like to make a library of some kind to find items that have been previously spread out amongst people and multiple files nad drives. I would either like to create a photo library for my mother, in case she ever wants to show people photos that she doesn't have saved on her phone OR I would create a library for sheet music of pieces that I've played before for all the different organizations, yet the latter might be a bit tougher since I don't have most of the sheet music digitally.</p>
