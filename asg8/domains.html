	<h2>Why This Domain Name?</h2>
		<p>Initially when coming up with the ideas for the website domain names I wanted to use a question in the name, because I rarely find question domains, so I thought it would be easy to find, however, as I kept brainstorming I realized that concept only really works if you use uncommon words in the question. Obviously, I would like to avoid having a domain name too similar to another to avoid confusion, but mayb considering using a word other than "equipment" as the main fcous might also be the play. I would prefer if the domain name still has the word equipment in it, but it may not necessarily be able to be the main focus, as it is not uncommon enough.</p>
		<p>Once I discussed my thoughts with my peer, I realized that I could possibly phrase the question in a way that would allow for it to not be similar to another domain name, even with a similar content or topic. One note that my peer mentioned is that I could potentially personalize the domain name by putting something that meant something to me as part of the title of the webpage. The first thing I thought of based on that comment was to put my own name, specifically my last name since it is significantly less common, and there is only one other company in existance with the same name and spelling which is Procter & Gamble. The only very obvious aspect to us both was that I should probably use the .tech part for the name because it is the most closely related and decently common part and may not be nearly as expensive.</p>
