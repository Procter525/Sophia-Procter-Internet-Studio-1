	<h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>

	<h2>White Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>We said this hat is the logical and neutral hat. The people that are represented by this hat seem to be very information based and are probably excellend at logistics. One thing that my partner mentioned was how this kind of person is very straight forward and does not really tolerate miscommunication or being misinformed in anyway. To me that seems to also imply that a White Hat person also despises lies in general.</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>My view point of the White Hat personality traits did not change much, but the concepts of how they think kind of openned my eyes to a different way of understanding the world because of the discussion we had. A White Hat person is very much not always straight forward and often sees different logical matters where someone else might see a problem. Another point was that this kind of person would theoretically be a keen observer because of how they are described to view situations.</p>
	
	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>This person was imagined as the "lovey-dovey" person, in a sense. They seem to worry about what other people feel and how they feel. Something that was mentioned by my partner was that this person is probably either really in tune with their emotions ro does not understand them at all, to which I commented something along the line of those emotions are probably control this type of person's life. But that would only be if the latter of what my partner said is accurate, though I wouldn't be surprised if it were.</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>Thoughts and feelings have always clashed in my personal life so reading about the Red Hat person as well as talking about them to my partner has been kind of strange. This is in regard to my person thoughts and feelings fighting each other, whereas, a Red Hat person is at least partially in tune with their emotions as it is where their thuoghts and logic appears to come from.</p>

	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>When talking about this type fo person I immediately thought this was a judgement version of a White Hat person, as in the judge based on facts, upon further discussion with my partner, I have grown to understand that there is a lot more depth to this type of person. For one, they seem to be very analytical, most likely always asking questions, but they can also be very helpful by using those questions to help solve problems.</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>I supposed through discussion with my partner I learned how much that I personally judged the Black Hat person before truly attempting to understand them. In hind sight, having talked about the possibilities of the capabilities of someone who thinks like this most of the time, they are probably great at fixing things, whether for work, or even around the house, and this mindset has shown me what it could mean to strive for optimum problem solving skills, which could be genuinely helpful later in life.</p>

	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Immediately I think of a happy-go-lucky person with this description, however, my partner said that they more thought of someone that is hopeful, not necessarily happy all the time. Of course the first thing that comes to mind when I think of hopeful is Superman, but in a way I also consider Superman to be a happ-go-lucky person, even though his life is full of tradgedy and pain. Which begs a question of does this type of person hide their pain by using this optimism as a front?</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>When diving deeper into the discussion with my partner, I quickly found out that there are genuinely people with that outlook that do not actually use it to cover something up, in fact, they find it the best way to keep going after something has gone wrong or something bad has happened in their lives. And this brought me to consider my own outlook, and how I cannot imagine how I came to that conclusion in the first place, because my partner pointed out that I actually am a lot like this Yellow Hat person.</p>

	<h2>Green Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Creativity seems to be the word with this one, which both my partner and myself agree with that statement. These types of people seem to always be searching for a way outside of the box or for something new. They probably are nto huge fans of tradition or even habitual exercises, and maybe having to do those habitual things has lead them to creativity out of needing somewhere to go to avoid that train of thought or as an outlet.</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>Another suggestion that my partner brought up is that these Green Hat people use their Green Hats to counter the habitual exercises that people do in daily life, because in some regards people have to complete these habitual exercises to get on with their day, such as brushing teeth or eating regular meals, though many people nin this world probably do not follow those habits exactly, they can still become cumbersome which may be what leads these types to people to show their creativity.</p>

	<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Every organization, group or business needs management. To help groups of people achieve goals is important because productivity level can mean the difference between something ending up terrible for a group of people or amazing. Thinking in terms of others one hundred percent of the time also appears to be taxing, which is something my partner also pointed out. We tend to agree that the management of others is largely beneficial, but also requires lots of work to keep everyone on track.</p>
		<h3>Post-Discussion</h3>
			<p>During this discussion, my partner pointed out how much management I do myself, which I suppose is why I have such a full schedule, but it also makes sense to me that a Blue Hat person would want to manage people and organizations. This is because of the idea of wanting to be in the know, which is what I responded to my partner about. Wanting to know what is going on and to stay informed is a large part of good project management, because to desire to be informed is to have a better grasp of what is going on, because you want to remember it, which is how I see Blue Hats thinking.</p>
