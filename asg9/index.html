	<h1>Sophisticated Simpletons</h1>
	<p>We are the Sophisticated Simpletons. We have a lot of charm and a lot of backstory, but may not be the smartest in the world. We're the lovable group that will steal your heart with our personalities rather than our thought processes, but that does not matter because we work well as a team. This team is regularly defeated, but always comes out on top in spirit and sportsmanship and will do whatever they can to help each other and others when it counts.</p>

		<h3>Grim</h3>

		<p>Our Team Leader is Grim. He is powerful and does not tolerate nonsense, but he will stay by his team's side no matter what. This is because he wants to, we swear, he did not lose another limbo contest.</p>

		<h3>Wile E. Coyote</h3>

		<p>Our resident runner is Wile E. Coyote. He has been running his whole life chasing someone that keeps getting away, and he is finally over it. Now, confined to a specific area, he is ready to take down anyone that gets in his way.</p>
