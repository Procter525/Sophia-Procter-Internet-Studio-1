	<h1>Hera Syndulla</h1>
		<div id="hera">
		<p><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hera_Syndulla">Hera Syndulla</a> is a leader of the Rebel Alliance who has been fighting for the freedom of all peoples since the Empire took over in 19BBY. She is from the planet Ryloth and is a Twi'lek as well as the daughter of revolutionist and public figurehead Cham Syndulla, so her fighting spirit definitely runs in the family.</p>
			<aside>
				<h1>Kanan Jarrus</h1>
					<p>Hera Syndulla's running mate is <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus">Kanan Jarrus</a>, her long time partner that has been with her since before the formation of the Rebel Alliance. He has been a part of major Rebellion opperations and has backed up Hera in her endeavors with creating the Rebel Alliance and in taking down the Empire. He is willing to continue to stand by her side after all this time which is a testiment to both of their characters.</p>
			</aside>
		<p>Hera Syndulla is a good candidate because of her experience as a leader of the Rebel Alliance, as she went from being a part of an individual sector to helping to bring together the vast majority of the overall Rebel Alliance to bring down the Empire. She has had thousands of persons under her command and has been trusted with the most dangerous of missions for years. Her candidacy is based in truth and willingness to help others in their time of need.</p>
